TEST TRAINER: a program designed to teach testing techniques and to teach through testing

Project Objectives and Description: The Test Trainer is designed as an “intelligent” test; e.g., as you are answering questions, the test redesigns itself to guide you in the right direction. Sometimes this will take the form of hints, other times the question will be broken down into smaller parts. The Test Trainer is meant as a supplement to traditional education and should be accompanied by regular practice in the subject area. However, use of the Test Trainer alone will make you a better test taker.

Installation: The package can be downloaded by cloning the url:
https://github.com/SamCD/TestTrainer.git

Running the Program:

Instantiate Student class:
    me = Student()

if you would like to take a graded test:
    me.take_test(subj,lvl)
where subj is a string either 'scale' or 'chord' and lvl is an integer 1 or 2
    

After multiple attempts, grades, study hints and remarks are written to a text file called “your_name.txt”.

Using the program:
As stated in the “Project Objectives and Description”, the program is meant to be used an a supplement to traditional teaching techniques. The comments should be used by the teacher to help facilitate communication with the student. The review is for the student, to help guide their studies.
